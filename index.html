    <h3>About Me:</h3>

    <p>
      Hi, I'm Dominic Hallam. I started my coding journey in 2024 when I decided it was time for a change in career.
      After researching the industry I landed on coding and web development. I have always enjoyed creative hobbies, so this really spoke to me. 
      I have really enjoyed researching other websites and learning how they work and taking inspiration from them.
      <br>
      So far I have learnt the fundamentals of:
    <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
      I have gained experience using online labs to create websites from scratch as well as practicing debugging errors, and I have set myself up on GitHub.<br>
      Having seen what the different coding languages are capable of, I am excited to continue my journey and develop my skills further.
      I have particularly enjoyed learning about JavaScript and how it improves the interaction between the site and user.<br>

    <h3>Projects:</h3>

    <p>You're look at it!<br>
       So far this is my first project and I'm really keen to continue improving it. I have tired to implement as many of the skills that I have learnt
       to make this page as appealing as possible. In future, I hope to master the art of JavaScript and add some interactive bits of code!
