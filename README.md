Welcome To My Portfolio Project!
================================

About:
------
* This is my first project and the start of my coding career. 
* This project aims to show off what i have learnt so far from my time with Learning People. 

This project has been created using HTML and CSS. I will use this as a template and continue adding different bits of code as I learn, hopefully JavaScript next.

Information:
------------
There is a navigation bar at the top of the page that will remain at the top of the users viewport. You can use this navigation bar to quickly take you to a particular part of the Portfolio.

Sources:
--------
I have conducted extra research to assist with development, the below sources are what was used.
**Header name:** I used a YouTube tutorial to help me with the text fading in. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syg_9iB1vco

**Navigation Bar animation**: I used an Instagram tutorial to help me create an animated navigation bar. https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-PclYfyZzK/ 

**Transparent Header image:** I used stackoverflow to help me find out how to create an opaque effect on a certain part of an image. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26622143/is-it-possible-to-make-certain-parts-of-an-image-transparent-in-html5-css

**Email link:** I wanted to create a link so that when you clicked on the email address in the contact section it opened up the users default mail app. I found some information using stackoverflow. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39970805/how-to-create-a-html-button-that-opens-outlook-application

**Media tags:** I research media tags in an attempt to try and ensure my site scaled down to the right size depending on the device, or size of the web browser if it was adjusted.
